## Summary
Submission for Peer-Graded Assigment as a part of Getting and Cleaning Data course in Coursera's Data Science Specialization

Repository contains instructions and code for tidying data from UCI Machine Learning Repository's Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

## Dataset
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files
- **CodeBook.md** : Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data.
- **run_analysis.R** :  
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
